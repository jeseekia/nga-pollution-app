		<p> The neighborhood we will be covering on this website is the Northend of Detroit, Michigan. The zip codes are 48202 and 48206. Some interesting places in the Northend are WNUC, Red Door, Safe House, NEWCC, O.N.E. Mile, 4 Ward Phoenix, and People's Platform. WNUC is a community radio station here. The Safe House is a block patrol that keeps an eye on their neighborhood community. NEWCC is a public transit that is accessible, affordable, accountable, and equitable for those who are transit dependent. O.N.E. Mile Detroit is a multi-disciplinary collaborative effort to support the cultural production and social economic activity in Detroitâ€™s epic North End neighborhood. 4 Ward Phoenix is a community based business developed to help prevent joblessness from reoccurring, and People's Platform is a broad network of Detroit-based social justice organizations, activists, and residents committed to bringing about just transformation in economics and social dynamics through popular education, celebration, and organizing. Pollution is important in this particular area because it is an error a lot of people make everyday. By polluting, they're causing the neighborhood to become unsanitized.</p>
