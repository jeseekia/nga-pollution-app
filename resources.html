			<h1>Top air pollutants, their sources, and impacts on health:</h1>

<h2>Carbon Monoxide</h2> Carbon Monoxide (or CO), is an odorless gas that is produced in motor vehicle exhaust and industrial activities such as steel production. High concentrations of CO in the air reduce the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. In healthy people, this can cause a difficulty concentrating. In people with existing heart conditions, CO can cause chest pain and increase the risk of heart attack.

Nitrogen Dioxide: Nitrogen Dioxide (or NO2) is a bad-smelling gas that is produced in motor vehicle exhaust, oil refining, electricity generation, and manufacturing. NO2 is linked to respiratory problems as it causes swelling in the lungs and decreases resistance to lung infections. In healthy people, it increases the risk of colds, bronchitis, and flue. In people with asthma, it can produce more frequent and intense asthma attacks.

Ozone: Ozone (O3) is a gas that may be colorless or may appear as a whitish haze. It is produced when Nitrogen Oxides (see above) interacts with other chemicals commonly found in the air in sunlight, so it is worst on high-pollution days in the summer. It can irritate the nose, airways, and lungs, causing pain in the eyes, ears, nose and throat or coughing and chest pain. In people with asthma, it can produce more frequent and intense asthma attacks.

Sulfur Dioxide: Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is an invisible gas that has a nasty, sharp smell. It is produced in industrial activities that burn sulfur, such as electricity generation from burning coal or gas, metal processing, oil refining, and waste incineration. It irritates the airways and lungs and causes coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. Its effects are worst for those with asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Particulate Matter: Particulate matter includes dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and water vapor that can be produced through natural sources and human activity. Some of the main sources are large fires, vehicle exhaust, and industrial processes. Exposure to particulate matter in the air can cause respiratory conditions such as asthma and bronchitis and cardiovascular disease. Particles that result from burning have also been linked to higher risk of cancer. Impacts are worst for young children and the elderly.</h1>
